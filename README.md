This is a Super Meat Boy ripoff that I made in Gamemaker Studio 1.8 (maybe 1.4?) over the course of a few months in my Sophomore year of college.<br>
I had never used GameMaker before, so making this game was mostly a means by which to learn GML.<br>
It's only got a handful of levels because I lost interest in ripping off someone else's platformer, so there are actually many assets that are fully coded and never used. When the game ends, sit there for a minute or so, and you'll get dropped into a room with most of those assets.<br>
In total, 1131 lines of code.<br>
